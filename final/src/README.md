# Betty

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This web application was created by Tyler Horwitz and Colton Crum for their Feature 6 assignment. The web app used back4app to store and fetch user data and information. The project is made in conjunction with Last Night LLC. We intend to fill the gap between bookys and unregulated bets, tapping into a vast marketplace.

## Acknowledgements

The feature was foundationally made by both Tyler and Colton together in previous project snippets. However, three sprints were headed off by both devs in order to satisfy the final feature 6 requirements.

- Tyler completed the following sprints:

  - Display a feed of suggested bets

  - Ability to create a custom bet to display in the feed of all users, in order to propose own bet

  - Dynamically filtering bets based on bet code. Can look up bets by their uniquely identified code.

  - Added CSS styling and feature design

- Colton completed the following sprints:

  - Pull upcoming and current MLB games into a dashboard using API call, object parsing

  - Logout function for users

  - Users search for bets by BetID.

  - Added navigation routing from page to page through flexbox.

  - Added CSS styling to navigation and pages

### Contribution Notes

The initial sprints claimed by both devs in the Google Sheet have evolved since the inception of the project. Tyler initially claimed the CSS sprint, but Colton ended up doing most of this sprint, including adding navigation features. Colton initially claimed the bet lookup sprint, but Tyler ended up doing most of this sprint. There was also some overlap, as some sprints depended on the other's work, so there was significant collaboration on several sprints. Please reference the above contribution list when determining success with deliverables. Thank you.

## Next Steps

- Adding more fluid UIBeefing up security

- Forgot password

- Email verification

- Add more sports other than MLB
