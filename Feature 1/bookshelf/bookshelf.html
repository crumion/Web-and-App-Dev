<p>What's one book that changed you life? When I was 14 it was Catcher in the Rye. Likely there's been a few books that made you think differently about the world, or pointed you in a new direction. I believe there's thousands of books that can radically change the way we think, but we won't ever read them. This is my journey in finding those books that change my life.</p>
